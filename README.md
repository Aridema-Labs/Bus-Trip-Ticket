# Bus Trip Ticket

A blockchain-validated system that allows you to certify bus trips. Very useful for the Argentine paradigm that does not have the technology of the first world.
Possess hardware not yet developed that would have the functionality to validate the trip. I mean, a card with a pubkey inside that signs a pda. Like any card, care must be taken against possible theft of the card.
